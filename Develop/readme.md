Password Generator 
All variables and arrays are stored in the "parent" variable

All the scripts are activated by the click of the "generate password" button

The user would then be prompted of the amount of characters they wish (8-128) for their password

Then they will have 4 confirms on whether they want lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters

The characters are coded in the if statement and are logged to the console

The Password is then generated within the code of the giant "for loop" which will generate the user selections

Then the password will be generated on the page
